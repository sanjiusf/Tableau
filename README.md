# Visual Exploration of Infant mortality Rates 
In this project we have:

1. Performed exploratory analysis of infant mortality rates due to malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea across the globe from 2000-2016 and merged the datasets using inner join in Tableau.
2. Compared the mortality rates of each disease using visualization tools and found decrease in global mortality rate from 2000-2016 by 50%.
3. Related the figures of five countries with high infant death rates and the preventive care used by them using visualizations and concluded that the preventive care was working in the countries and it was one of the factors for mortality rate decrease.

Tools Used: Tableau
